#### Chrome Battery Notifier
Chrome OS (at least version 41) does not allow users to change the built-in defaults, which seem to be 1%. This is a small Chrome extension which provides 3 configurable battery notifications.  They can be triggered by either
- percent of battery power remaining, or
- estimated time left

Requires Chrome v.38, which provides an excellent battery API.
